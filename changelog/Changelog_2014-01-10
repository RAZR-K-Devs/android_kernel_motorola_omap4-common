bbc75cf  random: Statically compute poolbitshift, poolbytes, poolbits Use a macro to statically compute poolbitshift (will be used in a subsequent patch), poolbytes, and poolbits.  On virtually all architectures the cost of a memory load with an offset is the same as the one of a memory load.

ffa7296 dm table: set flush capability based on underlying devices DM has always advertised both REQ_FLUSH and REQ_FUA flush capabilities regardless of whether or not a given DM device's underlying devices also advertised a need for them.
a754886 dm crypt: optionally support discard requests
85ddb79 dm table: share target argument parsing functions Move multipath target argument parsing code into dm-table so other targets can share it.
60b1af5 dm: ignore merge_bvec for snapshots when safe Add a new flag DMF_MERGE_IS_OPTIONAL to struct mapped_device to indicate whether the device can accept bios larger than the size its merge function returns.  When set, use this to send large bios to snapshots which can split them if necessary.  Snapshot I/O may be significantly fragmented and this approach seems to improve peformance.
b3e4c6c dm table: clean dm_get_device and move exports There is no need for __table_get_device to be factored out. Also move the exports to the end of their respective functions.
8cc6e86 dm: use vzalloc
