af3d56b remoteproc: get suspend address from resource table The suspend address is used as a flag to check if the remoteproc has actually suspended. The address could vary according to the memory map in the remoteproc. Changing the memory map in the remote processor changes the value of the suspend address. Passing the address in the resource table information avoids hardcoding the value in the platform data of the remoteproc. The value is instead assigned while parsing the resource table.
24e746b omap4: hdmi: adding a macro for acr wa dependency with rpmsg and ipu Hdmi acr workaround is based on the creation of an rpmsg channel to start/stop the workaround in the ipu remote processor. If the ipu remoteproc or rpmsg are disabled by menu config, the build is broken.

c7810a8 OMAP4: HDMI: sync to TI-OpenLink: Fix audio delay in resume from suspend This change is to bypass the wait_for_audio_stop loop if turning off hdmi for resync after resume while playing audio. This fixes slow system response and the delay in the return of audio after resume. OMAPS00260109 Device will become slow if you play music with HDMI while wakeup from suspend.
76b2ad5 ASoC: OMAP: HDMI: Sync to TI-OpenLink: ASoC: OMAP: HDMI: Defer audio transfer start Defer audio transfer after HDMI AUDIO wrapper is enabled. If audio transmit was started along with audio wrapper enabling, spurious data (zeros) was sent at the beginning of the transfer as part of the of audio sample packets, due an AUDIO FIFO UNDERFLOW, which was shifting audio channels.

These constraints are actually needed only on OMAP4 and beyond for sub-systems that have an AMMU. The current driver code has these values hard-coded for all the chips.
