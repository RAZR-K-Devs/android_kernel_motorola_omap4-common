49db5bc Intelli-Tweaks: Enable and adapt Faux's Intelli-Stuff as main default for JBX. Intelliactive is now default governor (but tweaked a little for our CPU power) Intelli-Plug updated to latest version (but of course keep my hotplug patches to allow CPU 1 to go offline only in idle mode - hotplugging while device is active, even when happening multiple times within a few seconds, eats more power than safe some! Itelli-Demand - Re-enabled and adapted tzo better compatibility with our CPU) Use other Intelli-related options, like CPUFREQ_ID_PERFLOCK to make all Intelli-drivers work best with JBX-Kernel
